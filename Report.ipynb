    "\"Independent Study: Introduction to Deep Learning\" is an independent study class conducted by Krystal Ly and advised by Dr. Anthony Bonifonte. The main focus of the class is to explore Deep Learning through readings, online courses, and a central project. Throughout the course, we have a chance to apply data analysis skills including, but not limited to, web scraping, data wrangling, data visualization, data modeling, and so on. In addition, we explore the basic of neural network, back propagation, different activation functions, and so on. This report serves as a comprehensive summary of what have been done in the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this independent study is to develop a foundational understanding of deep learning, combine data analysis skills and the new knowledge to work on an exploratory project, explore the interpretability of neural network models in deep learning, and explore the different choices being made in the process of building a deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part B of the report gives an overview of the project (the methodology and data being used). Part C summarizes the data collection, exploratory data analysis, and data wrangling process. The feature engineering and modeling part are then explained in part D. The last part then gives a conclusion.\n"

These book-tag scores are computed through a complex process using a multilevel nonlinear regression model. The input data involves the tag applications correspond to tags that users attach to books, user reviews, user ratings, and user survey.

    "When training neural network models, there are many choices to make, and these choices can affect the result. One of the most major choices is the choice of the number of epochs, which is the number of iterations we should run on our model. On the one hand, if we train our models on too few iterations, the model may underfit the train and validation sets. On the other hand, if we train our models on too many iterations, the model may overfit the training dataset and hence, have a poor performance on the validation set. \n",

The M-P neuron model was an important early step in the development of neural networks and artificial intelligence. Although it has some limitations and is not widely used today, it was one of the first attempts to model the workings of biological neurons using mathematics and logic. The basic concepts behind the M-P neuron model have influenced the development of more advanced neural network models, such as the perceptron and multi-layer perceptron. \n",

    "In neural networks, an activation function of a neuron is a mathematical function that is applied to the output of that neuron given an input or set of inputs. The activation function takes the weighted sum of the inputs and biases of a neuron and applies a non-linear transformation to it, producing the output of the neuron. It introduces non-linearity to the model and allows the neural network to learn complex, non-linear relationships between input and output data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Eigendecomposition: The next step involves finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions or axes in the feature space along which the data has the most variance, while eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select principal components: The eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues. This ranking reflects the importance of each principal component in capturing the variability in the data. The first principal component captures the most variance in the data, followed by the second, the third, and so on. Typically, only a subset of the principal components is selected, based on the desired amount of variance we want to retain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project the data to create a new dataset using PCA: The selected principal components are used to create a new feature subspace. The original high-dimensional data is projected onto this subspace to obtain the lower-dimensional representation. This is done by multiplying the original data matrix by the matrix of eigenvectors, corresponding to the selected principal components."

    "Although the tag scores calculated by the TagDL algorithm theoretically have the range from -0.2 to 1.18, the tag scores in reality have different ranges for different tags. Some tags (features) have the theoretical range but some have significantly smaller range. The differences in range may lead to the model being influenced by a few variables that have a larger range. Therefore, feature scaling may result in the model improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For feature scaling, there are two common methods: standardization and normalization. Normalization is a technique used to rescale numeric values in a dataset to fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value from each observation and then dividing by the range of the data. On the other hand, standardization involves transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done by subtracting the mean from each observation and then dividing by the standard deviation of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "While normalization can rescale all features to a specific range, it is vulnerable to the impact of outliers. In contrast, standardization may not bring all features to a specific range, but it is more robust to outliers, and it tends to result in features with similar ranges. Therefore, in this case, we opt to use standardization as our preferred method for scaling the data.\n",

    "The validation accuracy and f1 score increases dramatically for the first 23 or 24 epochs. Then these scores increases at a much lower rate. The validation loss decreases dramatically for the first 53 or 54 epochs before slowing down. The model converges to a good solution even much faster than the previous models. With only 160 epochs, the validation accuracy is 0.957, and the model f1 score is 0.894. Although the model needs less time to converge to a good solution, the validation accuracy and model f1 score don't improve compared to the previous models. In addition, there might be an overfitting problem as with 160 epochs, the training accuracy is 0.988 and the training F1 score is 0.972. This problem may occur because there is so much noise in the data. Because of the noise, the validation data is too different from the training data. Therefore, applying the same scaling parameters of the training data to the validation data may lead to skewing the data in an unexpected way.\n"

    "Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the Sklearn's Logistic Regression as the external estimator that can assign weights (coefficients) to features. First, the Logistic Regression model is trained on the initial set of features and the coefficient of each feature is obtained either through any specific attribute or callable. Then, the least important features (coefficients closest to 0) are pruned from current set of features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached."

    "We are interested in seeing the relationship between the number of most important features that the model is trained on and the model performance.

The result is the ranking of all features in terms of feature importance.\n",

We also expect that as the number of features increase, the validation loss and the number of epochs decrease. Overall, the number of epochs has a downward trend which is consistent with what we expect. However, the validation accuracy, F1 score, and loss have no trends at all and fluctuate dramatically. At around 130 and 360 number of features, the validation accuracy and F1 score decrease dramatically, and the validation loss increases dramatically. More work is needed to figure out the reason behind this.\n",

With just one feature, the model can achieve a validation accuracy of 0.92, and a validation F1 score of 0.836. This is quite significant since the best result we can get so far is approximately 0.96 in validation accuracy and 0.907 in validation F1 score. The second most important feature is \"adult\", followed by \"young adult\", \"romance\", \"fantasy\", and \"high school\". The least important feature is \"divorce\". These all make sense.\n",

    "### I. Limitations\n",
    "As the project is a part of the learning and exploring process, there are many limitations. Firstly, the dataset used in the project has only 9374 observations. This number of observations make the dataset not very suitable for a complicated Deep Learning Project so most of the models in the project are simple. More data is needed to train more complicated model and improve the model performance. Secondly, there are too many features compared to the number of observations. Although some actions have been taken to overcome this, the models do not improve and suffer from the overfitting problem. Thirdly, we haven't taken any actions to figure out why the model performance and the number of most important features used do not correlate. \n",

    "### II. Next Steps\n",
    "1. Explore other genres and train models on them to see if we come across the same problems\n",
    "2. Take actions to figure out why the model performance and the number of most important features used do not correlate\n",
    "3. Explore different neural network architectures \n",
    "4. Gather more data or conduct the project with the movie dataset which has relatively similar features but more observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, the independent study \"Introduction to Deep Learning\" provided a comprehensive exploration of deep learning concepts and their application in data analysis. Throughout the study, various data analysis skills were utilized, including web scraping, data wrangling, data visualization, and modeling. The primary goal was to develop a foundational understanding of deep learning and apply it to an exploratory project. The report served as a culmination of the acquired knowledge and showcased the ability to work on complex problems in the realm of data analysis."
